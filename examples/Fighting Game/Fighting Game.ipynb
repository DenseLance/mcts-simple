    "## Introduction\n",
    "Do you know about Pokemon? Well this turn-based fighting game is similar to Pokemon, but we do not send out monsters to duke it out. Instead, the battle is between humans. Since the actions that can be taken by both players are the same, there is some form of game theory involved and we can determine the Nash equilibrium of the game through the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Players start with 100 health. For each turn, players can choose one of four actions available:\n",
    "1. <b>Attack</b> <i>{DAMAGE SKILL}</i> (opponent is damaged for 8-12 health) \n",
    "2. <b>Heal</b> <i>{HEAL SKILL}</i> (self is healed for 7-10 health)\n",
    "3. <b>Power Up</b> <i>{BUFF SKILL}</i> (effectiveness of damage skills increase by 25%, to a maximum of 100%)\n",
    "4. <b>Superspeed</b> <i>{BUFF SKILL}</i> (chance of dodging a damage skill or sudden death effect increases by 5%, to a maximum of 100%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the 11th turn, sudden death will begin, and the players will be hit for 2 * (number_of_turns_passed - 10) health at the end of their turn. After turn 50, if both players have not fainted yet, the game is a draw. Players are able to dodge the effects of sudden death as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For buff skills, we will use the example of the skill \"power up\" to show how effects can stacked. When the player has used  \"power up\" twice, the effectiveness of damage skills is increased by 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit the various variables to see how the sequence of actions that lead to the best result would differ."
